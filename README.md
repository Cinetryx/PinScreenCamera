# PinScreenCamera
A nifty little [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch that coverts video from a webcam to something not unlike [Pin Art or a pinscreen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pin_Art) in real time.

This works by taking the the video from the webcame and shrinking it down so that each pixel of the resulting image matches a virtual pin. The pin is then moved closer to the camera depending on how bright the resulting pixel is. 

Pressing any key will start to save each frame as an image to the same directory as the sketch. With those you can make movies or GIFs.

This can be ran by just placing all of the .pde files in a directory then opening one of them in Processing. Have fun!
